    <h1 class="red-text">JavaScript & The DOM</h1>
    <h2 class="red-text">
      What is JavaScript and how does it relate to HTML and CSS</h2>
      
      <p class="red-text">JavaScipt can best best described as the animator in an animation. If the HTML is the model, and the CSS is the skin, then JavaScript tell the other two how to move. Or the same analogy using puppets, HTML is the puppet maker, CSS is the puppet painter and JavaScript is the puppet master.</p>
      
    <h3 class="red-text"> Control Flow & Loops</h3>
      
      <p class="red-text">The best way to describe control flow is the order in which things are done. For example when making a pizza, things have to be done in a certain order. If, for example you cook the base before adding toppings, it wouldn't really be a pizza.

        A loop is something that's done over and over again until it's done. For example, if you are sanding something, you sand one side, then do exactly the same thing on all sides. This repeating a task until a certain point is a loop, though of course the end has to be declared, or we would be sanding forever.
      </p> 
      
      <h4 class="red-text">What is the DOM and how do you interact with it.</h4>
      
      <p class="red-text">The DOM is the highest level excluding the string itself. If it was a hierarchy the DOM would be management or the officer, everything under it are the workers and grunts. So by telling the "boss" what to do, the orders will filter down rather than going to the grunts and telling all of them individually. JavaScript is one way we can issue orders to the DOM.</p>
      
      <h5 class="red-text">Accessing data from Arrays and Objects</h5>
      
      <p class="red-text">The difference between accessing date from objects and arrays is onject tend to be one fixed thing, while arrays are a collection of things with values determining what order they are in. So manipulating an object only needs to connect to one thing, but arrays can get more complicated</p>
      
      <h6 class="red-text">Why functions are useful</h6>
      
      <p class="red-text"> Functions are useful because they are the 'jobs' or 'busy work' of the code. By using functions we can ask the code to do things such as generate numbers, click buttons, do math, etc.</p>
