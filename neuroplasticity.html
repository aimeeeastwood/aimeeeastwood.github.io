      Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
      
      <p class="red-text">The principles of neuroplasticity tell us that adult brains are not, in fact, fixed and the wiring of neurons in the brain can still be rewired even in older ages. 
        This means that we are not condemned to have a certain brain, we can change it.
        The concept of neuroplasticity has many benefits, some notable example include cognitive behavioural therapy (for things like addiction, PTSD or personality disorders), muscle memory for certain skills (eg. playing the guitar or doing Kung Fu) or even getting rid of “bad habits”.</p>
      
    <h3 class="red-text"> Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
    </h3>
      
      <p class="red-text">Having been a teacher in Japan, I have learned some of this already. For myself it means if I learn in the right way, I’m not only likely to learn better, but even train my brain to operate in a certain “mode” that benefits what I’m trying to do, ie, coding.</p> 
      
      <h4 class="red-text">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
      
      <p class="red-text">Practice - The more obvious example of neuroplasticity is the simple concept of practice. The more you do an action, the more the neurons associated make a strong connection. Which is why I can play the guitar without thinking all that much, whereas a newbie would have to think a lot for the simple reason, I’ve been playing the guitar for over 20 years.
        Context- A lot of people learn better when there is a context. Trying to figure out a complex math equation is easier when you know what that equation is for, like flying to Mars. With context our neurons can link certain tasks to certain situations and better enable us to recall those skills when needed.
        Emotions/Confidence- The emotional component of neuroplasticity is very important. How we feel about certain things affects how neurons form. This is where confidence is important. If a student feels unconfident and has negative feelings associated with learning, they will not develop the neuron pathways as well as somebody who believes they can do the task and has more positive feelings toward it.
        This is why games are an effective way to practice skills, they build confidence and are fun! Never underestimate the power of fun.</p>

        Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
        </h6>
      
      <p class="red-text">Growth mindset mainly revolves around confidence and attitude. It is set apart from the more traditional “fixed mindset” in that a fixed mindset is concentrated in the binary “right/wrong” or “true/false” in the present, rather than a growth mindset which is more focused on progress rather than black and white results.
        This ties into confidence because a “fail” is not a “fail” but rather a “not quite there yet” reinforcing the notion that the student will get there eventually, rather than a “fail” being a door slamming shut.</p>

      <h7 class="red-text">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h7>

      <p class="red-text">Having been an ESL teacher, I was aware of the importance of confidence to learning, but seeing it put in these terms was new. I wasn’t surprised as much as interested in the way it was put.</p>

      <h8 class="red-text">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h8>

      <p class="red-text">Basically to try and not get down on myself if I don’t get things straight away. I will get it eventually. I just need to keep at it.</p>
