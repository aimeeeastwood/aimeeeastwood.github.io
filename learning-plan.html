        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
      </h3>
      <p class="red-text">
        I am very intersted in video games, 3D modeling and animation so a long,
        long term goal is to work in gaming. However my more short term goal is
        to be a web developer as it seems like a logical stepping stone and
        plays into my interst in visual designs and things like that.

      <h3 class="red-text">
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h3>
      <p class="red-text">
        I'm not so sure what my biggest strengths are except that I an pretty
        adaptable and hopefully, most of the time, not all that stubborn. My
        openess to new idea is probably my strength. My weakness is a kind of
        "stiff upper lip" mentality that leads me to not asking for help as much
        as I should. I really need to get better at that, because it could
        really hurt me in bootcamp.
      </p>

      <h3 class="red-text">
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h3>
      <p class="red-text">
        Online communication. I consider myself to be a pretty good communicator
        in person, but online is a different story. I even hate texting people
        or sending emails, would much prefer to just call or go and see them in
        person. However in coding, online communication is the norm. I need to
        get better at it, as much as I hate it.
      </p>

      <h3 class="red-text">
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p class="red-text">
        To find that middle ground between too much and too little confidence,
        and to realise it's the same for other people. Don't be lazy but don't
        be too hard on yourself. A tightrope.
      </p>

      <h3 class="red-text">
        What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
      </h3>
      <p class="red-text">
        To be avaibale to help and be able to walk students through things. To
        help with that tightrope between too much and too little confidence.
      </p>

      <h3 class="red-text">
        What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
      </h3>
      <p class="red-text">
        To be open minded, persistant and empathic to myself and others. I've
        watched some YouTube videos on JavaScript and without fail they say
        "It's hard so don't be discouraged, one day it will click" So I need to
        keep at it until that day comes.

      <h2 class="red-text">Foundations Learning Plan</h2>

      <h3 class="red-text">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p class="red-text">
        My long term goal is to learn how to become a web development dev, as
        well as learning skills to apply to AI and other creative applications.
        A very long term goal is to be a game dev.
      </p>

        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p class="red-text">
        I am very good at multitasking and learn new concepts very quickly. On
        the other hand I am naturally disorganised and can get distracted.

        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?A commitment to how you will manage
        your workload in this programme.
      </h4>
      <p class="red-text">
        The main thing I need to do is make sure I get myself into a schedule
        and stick to it. I'm even getting to the point where even if I've
        finished the course work, I'll do something else on the same computer,
        just to keep the habit up. Also it's important to start early so I can
        have a "buffer" for if I run into trouble.What you will do when things
        are building up and starting to get to you. This also means if things
        are getting too stressful, I can take a break and come back later with
        fresh eyes. In theory I should be leaving myself twice the time I think
        I need.
      </p>

      <h5 class="red-text">
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h5>
      <p class="red-text">
        Discord would be the best bet. But it is important to get onto seeking
        help early, as to leave yourself time.
      </p>

      <h6 class="red-text">
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </h6>
      <p class="red-text">
        Mainly to set clear expectations and be able to jump in if help is
        needed. Otherwise it is student driven, so long as the task is clear.
      </p>

      <h7 class="red-text"
        >Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h7
      >
      <p class="red-text">
        I don't really have any scheduling conflicts except on the weekend. I do
        however try to keep my "buffer" in case anything comes up.
