    <h1 class="red-text">My Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2 class="red-text">
      What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      
      <p class="red-text">My long term goal is to learn how to become a web development dev, as well as learning skills to apply to AI and other creative applications. A very long term goal is to be a game dev.
      </p>
      
    <h3 class="red-text">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h3>
      
      <p class="red-text">I am very good at multitasking and learn new concepts very quickly. On the other hand I am naturally disorganised and can get distracted.</p> 
      
      <h4 class="red-text">What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h4>
      
      <p class="red-text">The main thing I need to do is make sure I get myself into a schedule and stick to it. I’m even getting to the point where even if I’ve finished the course work, I’ll do something else on the same computer, just to keep the habit up. Also it’s important to start early so I can have a “buffer” for if I run into trouble.What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you. This also means if things are getting too stressful, I can take a break and come back later with fresh eyes. In theory I should be leaving myself twice the time I think I need.</p>
      
      <h5 class="red-text">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h5>
      
      <p class="red-text">Discord would be the best bet. But it is important to get onto seeking help early, as to leave yourself time.</p>
      
      <h6 class="red-text">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h6>
      
      <p class="red-text">Mainly to set clear expectations and be able to jump in if help is needed. Otherwise it is student driven, so long as the task is clear.</p>
    </p>

       <h7 class="red-text">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h7>

      <p class="red-text">I don’t really have any scheduling conflicts except on the weekend. I do however try to keep my “buffer” in case anything comes up.</p>
