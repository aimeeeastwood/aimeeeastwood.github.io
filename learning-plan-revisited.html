    <h1 class="red-text">Learning Plan Revisited</h1>

    <p class="red-text">
      This is my updated Learning & Wellbeing Plan for Bootcamp. It builds on my
      original Foundations plan and reflects what I’ve learned about how I work best.
    </p>

      <h2 class="red-text">Updated Bootcamp Learning & Wellbeing Plan</h2>

      <h3 class="red-text">Long-term Goal / Career Pathway</h3>
      <p class="red-text">
        I am really interested in video games, 3D modelling and animation. A long-term goal is to work in the gaming or creative technology space. In the short term, my goal is to become a web developer, which aligns with my skills in visual design and interactive experiences.
      </p>

      <h3 class="red-text">My Strengths</h3>
      <ul class="red-text">
        <li>Adaptable and open to new ideas</li>
        <li>Persistent when problem-solving — I keep trying until it works</li>
        <li>Pick up new concepts quickly when focused</li>
        <li>Creative with strong visual thinking</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="red-text">My Challenges / Growth Areas</h3>
      <ul class="red-text">
        <li>Delay asking for help, try to push through alone</li>
        <li>Online communication still feels less natural than in-person</li>
        <li>Can feel overwhelmed when workload stacks up</li>
        <li>Need to manage time to avoid distraction</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="red-text">Learning Goals During Bootcamp</h3>
      <table class="red-text">

        <tr>
          <td>Confidence in full-stack development</td>
          <td>Become capable in both frontend & backend</td>
          <td>Ask questions early, break tasks down</td>

      <h3 class="red-text">Workload & Help-Seeking Plan</h3>
      <p class="red-text">
        If I am stuck for more than ~30 minutes, I will reach out on Discord or ask a tutor/peer. I will keep a daily plan with small achievable tasks and start early to give myself buffer time.
      </p>

      <h3 class="red-text">Communication Plan</h3>
      <p class="red-text">
        I will contribute regularly in group discussions, check in when unsure, and keep communication open instead of waiting silently.
      </p>

      <h3 class="red-text">Wellbeing / Oranga Plan</h3>
      <p class="red-text">What keeps me well:</p>

        <li>Movement and stretching during the day</li>
        <li>Keeping a steady daily routine</li>

      <p class="red-text">What harms my wellbeing:</p>
      <ul class="red-text">
        <li>Trying to power through alone for too long</li>
        <li>Comparing my progress to others</li>
