    <h1 class="red-text">Identity, Values, and Strengths Exploration</h1>
    <h2 class="red-text">
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>
      
      <p class="red-text">A long time ago, a friend
      asked me to be a witness in a child custody case, and asked me to lie. I
      refused, even though I knew it was important to her. The idea of lying in
      a legal setting is just a bridge too far for me. It ended our friendship
      which I don’t like, but looking back, I made the right decision.</p>
      
    <h3 class="red-text"> Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and
      identity.</h3>
      
      <p class="red-text">I was raised in quite a English-lite Anglican middle class
      family. Growing up, telling the truth was extremely important as was the
      idea of dignity. Later I would move to Japan for 8 years and strangely
      found the way I was raised made it quite easy to fit into Japanese
      society, where honour and integrity are also extremely important. So to
      this day, my values revolve around honesty, fairness, and living for the
      greater good.</p> 
      
      <h4 class="red-text">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during
      your learning journey.</h4>
      
      <p class="red-text">I am Agnostic, but it cannot be denied that
      religion has had a massive influence on me. According to a test I did,
      Spirituality comes out on top. I think this means that I often think of
      the “big picture” when it comes to moral questions and even though I don’t
      follow any religion, I believe that there is a “bigger picture”. I believe
      this can help me to think beyond what's immediately obvious and dwell on
      the unforeseen. Honesty and bravery are high too. I value truth above most
      other things, and I also value trust. In a workspace that means I “own up”
      when I make a mistake, and if I promise to do something, I am honour bound
      to follow through. To me, especially in the world these days, honesty is a
      strength, that you can be trusted. The other is perspective. Maybe because
      of my time in the humanities (history and journalism), I’ve learned to see
      things from as many perspectives as possible. That doesn’t mean agreeing
      with all perspectives, but it does mean hearing them out and giving them a
      chance. I believe that more information is always better, and one of the
      biggest roadblocks people come across when dealing with others is an
      inability to escape one's own perspective. Evaluate your limitations in
      terms of your learning and career development.</p>
      
      <h5 class="red-text">How might these affect your
      learning journey?</h5>
      
      <p class="red-text">So, I am quite a “dark” gothy person, full admission. I
      am pretty sure I am neuro divergent. This combined with my values of
      honesty can cause problems, especially when dealing with people higher in
      the hierarchy than myself. I am also very chatty and easily distracted
      which can be extremely frustrating for my colleagues. Being organised and
      sticking to a schedule is also one of my weaknesses, though I do take
      steps to try and manage it, for example, always turning up early, using my
      phone's calendar and dividing my day into “need time” and “want time”.
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension.</p>
      
      <h6 class="red-text">Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.</h6>
      
      <p class="red-text"> I think when a band I was in was
      recording an album, I wanted strings on a couple of tracks but the other
      band members were skeptical. Words alone were enough, so I made a demo
      with keyboards on my own. Then they started to come around. I think the
      lesson here is about perspective and communication. My bandmates couldn’t
      hear what I heard in my head. And to be fair, they couldn’t be faulted for
      not knowing. And in that situation talk is not enough. You have to show.
      And very often people might not be on the same page as you, but it’s not
      that they are disagreeing with you, they just don’t see your perspective.</p>
