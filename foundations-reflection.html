    <h1 class="red-text">My Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2 class="red-text">
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h2>
      
      <p class="red-text">I've learned that confidence is a huge part of learning. Too confident, I get lazy. Not confident enough, I get paralised by anxiety. I need to be somehwere in the middle.</p>
      
    <h3 class="red-text">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
    </h3>
      
      <p class="red-text">I think for values it's mostly just trying to do my best and be honest about the problems I run into. With empathy and self aweness, it's become pretty important mostly because of the virtual nature of the course. When you don't really communicate with people in you cohort a lot, it's easy to think everyones doing better than you, worse than you or anything else. To realise that everyone is finding it challenging help with confindence, but also shows the need for empathy as people have lives outside of Dev Academy, just as I do.</p> 
      
      <h4 class="red-text">What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h4>
      
      <p class="red-text">Confidence. Confidence has a huge impact on learning as noted above about "ego". Ego is very powerful and no matter how smart you might be, if your feeling stuck and stupid, it gets very hard to figure things out.</p>
      
      <h5 class="red-text">What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h5>
      
      
      <p class="red-text">As is always the case, it's easy to say what human skills others are getting right nad wrong, for yourself is another matter. Which means self-aweness. Looking at the way we communicate and related to others can be a little confronting</p>

      <h6 class="red-text">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h6>
      
      <p class="red-text">Because Human Skills are important to pretty much anything, and people who lack them can run into problem working in the real world. An example is the world best physist dones't mean the best physics teacher, espeically if their communication skills are bad. But a teacher who know physics a bit but is really good at communicating is going to be the better teacher. All jobs work this way. Because all jobs require interacting with people.</p>
    </p>

       <h7 class="red-text">Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h7>

      <p class="red-text">No, but my background is in music, art, ESL teaching and journalism, all of which are in the "humanities". So I've been pretty aware of the impoantace of human skills my entire professional life. Doesn't mean I can't get better though, so I don't feel it's a waste of time. For me, I'm used to working directly with people, so doing Human SKills over the net is still a learning curve for me.</p>
