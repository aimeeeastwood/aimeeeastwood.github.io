      What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
    </h1>

    <h2 class="red-text">Margin</h2>
    <p class="red-text">
      Margins are external elements and exists "outside" the html file. Usually
      is determines the space between the physical edge of the screen and the
      edge of the html file. To think of it as the "outside space" is pretty
      accurate.
    </p>

    <h3 class="red-text">Border</h3>
    <p class="red-text">
      The border is literally that. A border between the "outside space" and the
      "inside space". It is the picture frame in which the content sits. The
      border can be either visable or invisable but it is there regardless.
    </p>

    <h4 class="red-text">Padding</h4>
    <p class="red-text">
      Padding is the amount of "inside space" between the border and the
      content. Setting the padding will determine where inside the border (or
      picture frame) the content will sit.
